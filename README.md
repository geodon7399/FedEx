<h1><b>FedEx Day #1</b></h1>
Utilize the matLibPlot library to create visualizations of data in two-dimensional chart form. Commuter time data downloaded from the census was used to demonstrate the library's capability.

<b>Goal of the Project</b>
--------------------------
The goal of the project was to successfully utilize the library and create "a" visualization of the data via scatter plot or heat map.

<b>Setup and Configuration</b>
--------------------------
I used Eclipse IDE as the development environment to experiment with this project. I also installed the add-on, PyDev which enables you to create Python projects, set the type of project (Python, Jython, or Iron Python), set interpreter, add dependencies to the project and so on.

Python needs to be installed as well as dependecies for the matLibPlot library. To properly setup, install the following in the order listed (for Win7).

* Python 2.6 or higher - http://python.org/download/releases/
* numpy 1.7.0 - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy
* matLibPlot 1.2.0 - http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html

Using the MSI installers are the easiest means of getting quickly setup. You can also download the tarballs and install manually via command line.
